# Project Details
### Entities and their responsibilities
- **Passenger**: Represent a customer booking flights
- **Flight**: Contains flight details (flight number, destination, seats, etc.)
- **Ticket**: Represents a purchased ticket.
- **BookingSystem**: Manages flight schedules, ticket purchases, and check-ins.

### Collections Usage
- **Array**: Used for storing flight seats
- **ArrayList**: Stores available flights or a list of passengers.
- **HashMap**: Maps passenger IDs to their tickets.
- **HashSet**: Used to track checked-in passengers for a specific flight.

### OOP Principles
- **Inhertance**: Different types of flights (e.g., DomesticFlight, InternationalFlight) extend a base Flight class.
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding methods for flight-specific rules.
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with public getter/setter methods.
- **Composition**: BookingSystem has a collection of Flight and Ticket objects.
